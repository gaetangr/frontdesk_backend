This module is responsible to handle signals for the users app
In a nutshell, signals allow certain senders to notify a set of 
receivers that some action has taken place. Theyâ€™re especially useful 
when many pieces of code may be interested in the same events

- The endpoint are defined in the `users.urls.py` module

- The logic are defined in the `users.views.py` module

- The serializer are defined in the `users.serializer.py` module

- The behiavors of the data are defined in the `users.models.py` module
